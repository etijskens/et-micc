Tutorial 1: a simple project
============================

Let's start with a simple problem: a Python module that computes the 
`dot product of two arrays <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product>`_. 
This not a very rewarding goal, as there are already many Python packages, 
e.g. Numpy_, that solve this problem in an elegant and efficient way. 
However, because the dot product is such a simple concept in linear algebra, 
it allows us to illustrate the usefulness of Python as a language for High 
Performance Computing, as well as the capabilities of 
`micc <https://micc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Here are a number of interesting links covering Python as a language for
