Tutorial 1: a simple project
============================

Let's start with a simple problem. Let's try to make a Python module that 
computes the dot product of two arrays. This not a very rewarding goal, as 
there are already Python packages, e.g. Numpy, that solve this problem in
an elegant and efficient way. Yet because the dot product is such a simple
concept in linear algebra, it allows us to illustrate the usefulness of 
Python as a language for High Performance computing, as well as the capabilities
of *micc*.
