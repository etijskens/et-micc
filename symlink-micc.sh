# Execute this script in a micc project to test micc and micc-build on the current project.
# Any changes in:
#   . ~/software/dev/workspace/et-micc/et_micc/
#   . ~/software/dev/workspace/et-micc-build/et_micc_build/
# will be immediately visible in the project's virtual environment.

# Behaviour: The script replaces the installed python packages et_micc and et_micc_build,
# if present, with symbolic links to ~/software/dev/workspace/et-micc/et_micc/ and
# ~/software/dev/workspace/et-micc-build/et_micc_build/, respectively.
# If the current project is et_micc or et_micc_build, the script prints an error\
# message and exits.
